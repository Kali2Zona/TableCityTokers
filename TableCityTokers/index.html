                    <h3>Sativa</h3>
                    <p>Sativa strains are known for their uplifting and energizing effects. Originating from regions closer to the equator, they have longer flowering cycles and may thrive in warmer climates. Sativa strains are often associated with cerebral stimulation, increased creativity, and enhanced focus. Their higher THC content makes them popular for daytime use or social gatherings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Indica</h3>
                    <p>Indica strains are characterized by their relaxing and sedating effects. They have shorter flowering cycles and can be well-suited for indoor cultivation. Indica strains are renowned for their "body high" that alleviates pain, muscle tension, and promotes relaxation. They are commonly chosen for evening use or when seeking relief from anxiety, insomnia, or chronic pain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Ruderalis</h3>
                    <p>Cannabis Ruderalis originates from regions with short growing seasons. While not commonly used for psychoactive effects, Ruderalis genetics are valued for their autoflowering trait. This means they transition to the flowering stage based on age. Ruderalis genetics have contributed to developing hybrid strains with autoflowering capabilities, even though they are not widely used for recreational consumption.</p>
